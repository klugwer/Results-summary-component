# Results-summary-component
Built this responsive results card using HTML and CSS. Focused on layout with Flexbox, custom gradients, hover/active animations for the button, and consistent spacing. Didnâ€™t use semantic tags this time, but learned the importance of semantic structure and will apply it going forward ahha
